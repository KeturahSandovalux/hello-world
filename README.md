# hello-world
This is my first github repository - learned from: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
// I am 28 and am interested in coding. I love hackathons and Microsoft. I really am excited about learning to code and no one can stop me. I code because I enjoy learning about it. I'm learning C#.
